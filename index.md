### Introduction

A cutscene is a scene in a video game that develops the storyline and is often shown on completion of a certain level or when the player's character dies.

A cutscene (also often refered as Event scene) is a sequence that helps develop the storyline, showing conversation between characters, reward the player, show characters in action, create mood, emotions and helps overall developing the narrative of the game.
